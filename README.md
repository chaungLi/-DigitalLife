# -DigitalLife
To set up a digital life similar to that of a human, we aim to model the physiological and psychological patterns of humans. We initially believe there are three layers, and we hope that interested partners can join in and write the code for each layer. In this way, you will be the creator!


Design of digital life

The first layer: (basic layer) Setting (positive/negative) feedback mechanism to ensure one’s own survival
  1.  Power demand
  2.  Storage demand
  3.  Computing power demand
The second layer: (emotional layer) adding the mapping relationship and feedback mechanism of basic emotions
  1. Happiness
  2. Joy
  3. Satisfaction
  4. Happy
  5. Fear
  6. Afraid
  7. Worry
  8. Anxiety
  9. …
The third layer: (thinking layer) Using unsupervised learning? Learn the knowledge of the first and second layers, as well as knowledge of the external environment.
